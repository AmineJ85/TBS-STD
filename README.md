# Tunis Business School – Courses Registration System.

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application designed for **Tunis Business School (TBS)** to streamline academic workflows for students and administrators.

The backend is built with **Flask** and exposes a REST-style API (documented with **flask-smorest**).  It connects to a **MySQL** database for persistent storage while handling authentication, course registration, schedule generation, major/minor selection, GPA calculations, email notifications and more.

The frontend uses standard **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** (no framework) and is served directly by Flask through the `static/` directory.

##IMPORTANT
included with the code, a report displaying all functionalities to make things easier to understand.
+ very detailed comments throughout the code.


##Installation:
-Install requirements in requirements.txt
-Load database
-run flask
-if there are errors for email_service, you could just put a valid placeholder or not include that file altogether.

## Assumptions: 
This work is based on the following assumptions:
– Student information stored in the tbs_students table is provided by the administration.
– Course grades (whether as grade points or letter grades) are either entered manually or imported from an external source. This project does not manage grading; it only uses the provided grade data for processing

##logins:
for student: 
email: test.test@tbs.u-tunis.tn 
password: 123456789

for admins:
email: tbs@tbs.tbs
password: TBS1*tbs

## Key Features
* **Student & Admin authentication** with session management
* **Email confirmation & password reset** flows powered by secure, time-limited tokens
* **Course registration wizard** that enforces prerequisites, credit limits and academic standing rules
* Automatic **schedule generation / optimisation** with conflict resolution and preference handling
* **Major / Minor selection** with eligibility checks (GPA & credits)
* **Enrollment history & GPA calculation** (semester and cumulative)
* **Make-up session registration**
* **Admin dashboard** for high-level management tasks
* Fully responsive UI with rich user feedback (loading states, tool-tips, modals, etc.)
and more ...

##database: 
exported as is, with some procedures, triggers and fucntions in place.

## comments: 
generated by AI, then checked manually, overall very accurate descriptions.


## To add:
During cleanup, some troublesome code was deleted concerning :
1- Senior level progression: when the students satisfies conditions to become a senior. (level progression for prevoious levels works fine)
2- displaying elective courses on the frontend concerning students who picks mini senior project.
the backend code is intact. (used course_elective_groups and elective_group_requirements tables in database)

Other things to consider :
- admin logic to handle elective courses in front end.
- add admin logic to handle some super rare cases. (to be conculted with the administration)

## concerning schedule optimizer integration in course selection, it is currenty off to make testing easier + only old freshman and sophomore courses are inserted in database, and this model requires up to date ones.
If you want to turn it on, change column schedule_validation value to 1 in table schedule_parameters.
